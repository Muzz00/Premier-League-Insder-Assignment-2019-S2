            <h2>Relagation Contenders</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>There are few teams in contention to finish in the bottom 3 of the Premier League season.
                Teams such as Newcastle United, Watford, Norwich and Sheffield United are the teams
                likely to be battling out of the relegation scrap.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Watford have possible had the worst start the could imagine with them bagging only
                3 points from a possible 24. At this rate Watford would need a miracle to get out of
                the relegation zone. It is also hard to look past a financially struggling Newcastle
                United who have performed above expectations and thier key asset Ayoze Perez leaving
                to Leciester, it's most certain that Newcastle have little to believe for the chances
                of staying in the Premier League.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Norwich City are second from the bottom in the Premier League table.
                Although Norwich City are an attacking team they often leave a gaping hole at the
                back where other teams can exploit on the turn of possession. This has resulted in
                them having the most goals conceded in the league and its hard to see how they
                would find a balanced attack which could support the defence at times of need.
            </p>

        <h1>Relegation Battle.</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In my prediction, I expect Watford, Newcastle United and Norwich City to finish in the
            bottom 3 of the Premier League, which could result a shortage in revenue.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Premier League generates a whopping &euro;6,040,000,000 per season whilst the relageted
            teams move into the EFL Championship which genreates only &euro;842,000,000 per season.
            This would mean a massive hit on the clubs revenue hence there are battles between teams
            at the relegation level.
        </p>
