            <h2>Champions League Spots</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Having concluded that Manchester City and Liverpool FC will secure the top two spots;
                There are only another 2 spots which are being battled out between various clubs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Before the transfer market opened it was mind boggling to predict the 3rd and 4th
                places finishes. With Tottenham and Arsenal able to secure lucrative deals, it is
                easy to conclude that both Manchester United and Chelsea will be missing out on the
                Chapions League qualification spots.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Many have tipped Leicester to be the dark horses to be in contention for the Top 4
                spots. This is because Leicester City has seen a meteoric rise since they won the
                Premier League in the 2015-2016 season.

        <h1>Why it's important</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>UEFA gurantees spots for the Champions League for the teams that finish between 1-4 in the
            premier league.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It is important for clubs to secure Champions League Spots as it means more revenue are
            being generated for those respective clubs. This is because clubs will have more
            viewership, hence increasing bonuses for the clubs such as TV rights deal and a
            prize money worth of how far the club goes in the competition.
