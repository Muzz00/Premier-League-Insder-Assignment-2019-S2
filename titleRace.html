            <h2>Title Race</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The race for the title has heated up this season with Manchester City defending the
                title from the european champions Liverpool FC. With City having stregthening with
                the signings of Rodri and Cancelo whilst Liverpool being inactive in the transfer
                market, it seems the league has been wrapped up by the defeding champions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Before the transfer market opened it was mind boggling to predict the 3rd and 4th
                places finishes. With Tottenham and Arsenal able to secure lucrative deals, it is
                easy to conclude that both Manchester United and Chelsea will be missing out on the
                Chapions League qualification spots.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Champions of Europe having taken all 24 points from 8 games, and Man City only
                managing to squeeze out 16 points from the same time frame. We can expect the the
                league to pan out more more realistcly around Christmas time.

        <h1>The Deciding Factor</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In my opinion the title race for the Premier League comes down to games between Man City
            and Liverpool. This is because the were a mere 1 point gap between the winners and the
            runners up last season.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Both Anfield (Liverpool's stadium) and Etihad (Man City's stadium) are both known to be
            the fotress of both teams, and it will be fascinating to see who comes out on top on the
            respective games. Anfield is set to host Manchester City on the 10th November 2019 and
            the reverse fixture is scheduled to play on the 4th April 2020.
